# Java Spring

## Setup

Before starting to use the app itself, you'll need to setup:  

    - Your API Key & Secret  
    - The default theme path  

For your API Key, go in the [LoginRadius](src/main/java/com/loginradius/springdemo/LoginRadiusServices.java) file and change the informations to your key.  
For the theme path, go in the [properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) file and change the path to your absolute path.  

## Usage

Open a terminal and go in the [default path](.) and type `./mvnw spring-boot:run`  
Now you can go in your browser and open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and use it.
